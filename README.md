## Library of gnark circuits for TLS oracles

### How to run the repo
- make sure to use the gnark and gnark-lib versions in the go.mod:
    - `github.com/consensys/gnark v0.9.0-alpha`
	- `github.com/consensys/gnark-crypto v0.11.2`

The repo must be updated slightly to be compatible with the latest gnark and gnark-lib versions (minor things changed such as generating materials for the setup procedure with the testing package...)
